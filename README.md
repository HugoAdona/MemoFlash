# MemoFlash

MemoFlash is a simple flashcard application that allows you to create, edit, and delete flashcards. The flashcards are stored in the browser's local storage, so your data persists even after you close the application.

## Installation

To use MemoFlash, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No additional installation is required.

## Usage

1. Enter a question in the "Enter question" input field.
2. Enter the answer in the "Enter answer" input field.
3. Click the "Add Flashcard" button to create a new flashcard.
4. Click on a flashcard to flip it and reveal the answer.
5. Click the "Edit" button to edit the question and answer of a flashcard.
6. Click the "Delete" button to remove a flashcard.

Your flashcards will be automatically saved to your browser's local storage, so they will be available the next time you open the application.
